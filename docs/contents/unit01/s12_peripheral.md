# Peripheral Devices

A *peripheral device* is a device connected to a computer that helps us communicate with it. We use peripheral devices to send data into the computer or receive information from it. Peripheral devices allow us to interact with the computer, making it more useful and easier to use.

There are three main types of peripheral devices: input devices, output devices, and input/output devices.

## Input Devices

An *input device* is something we use to send information *into* the computer. For example, when we type on a keyboard, we are using it to give instructions and data to the computer. Other common input devices are the mouse, which helps us move around the screen and click on things, and a scanner, which can scan pictures or documents to add them to the computer. Input devices allow us to enter information, which the computer then processes.

## Output Devices

An *output device* is used to take information *out of* the computer so that we can see, hear, or feel it. For example, a monitor is an output device that shows images, videos, and text from the computer. Speakers are also output devices; they let us hear sounds, like music or voices, from the computer. Another example is a printer, which prints out information on paper. Output devices help us understand what the computer is doing or share the information with others.

## Input/Output Devices

Some devices are both input and output devices. For example, a touchscreen on a smartphone or a tablet lets us touch the screen (input) and shows us information at the same time (output). These types of devices help us communicate with the computer in both directions.

## How Peripheral Devices Connect to the Computer

Peripheral devices need to be connected to the computer to work. They connect to *ports*, which are special slots and openings on the computer’s case. Each device has a specific type of port or connection that it needs to use. For example, a keyboard might connect to a USB port, while speakers connect to an audio port.

There are two ways to connect peripheral devices to the computer: with cables or wirelessly.

- **Cables**: Many peripheral devices use *cables* to connect to the computer. Cables are the wires that carry data between the device and the computer. For example, a printer might use a USB cable, and a monitor might use an HDMI cable. Using cables is simple—just plug the device into the port, and you’re ready to go!

- **Wireless**: Some devices do not need cables; they use *wireless* technology to connect. This might include a wireless mouse, keyboard, or printer. Wireless connections are made through Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, and the computer can recognize the device without needing to be physically attached.

These peripheral devices make computers much more interactive and helpful for us, letting us see, hear, and share data easily.
