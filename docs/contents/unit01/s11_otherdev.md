# Other Devices for Domestic and Educational Use

Besides personal computers (PCs) and mobile devices like smartphones and tablets, there are other digital tools that are useful both at home and in schools. These devices help make learning more engaging and can also be used for various tasks around the house. Let’s look at some of these helpful devices.

## E-Readers

An *e-reader* is a special device made for reading digital books, or *e-books*. E-readers have screens designed to be easy on the eyes, which means they reduce eye strain and are comfortable to read for long periods, even in bright light. They are usually lightweight and can store thousands of books. This makes them great for students who need access to many textbooks or storybooks without having to carry heavy books around. E-readers are also convenient for reading while traveling or in small spaces. They have adjustable fonts, so readers can change the text size to suit their needs, making it easier for everyone to read comfortably.

## Smart Speakers

*Smart speakers* are devices that use voice commands to perform tasks. Examples of smart speakers include Amazon Echo and Google Home. These devices are helpful around the house because they can set alarms, play music, tell you the weather, and even control other *smart home* devices, like lights or thermostats. In educational settings, smart speakers can be useful for students who need quick facts or help with language learning. For instance, students can ask questions like “What’s the capital of France?” or “How do you say ‘hello’ in Spanish?” The smart speaker will answer, making learning fast and fun.

## Wearables

*Wearables* are small devices that can be worn on the body, like *smartwatches* or *fitness trackers*. These devices help monitor health and keep people connected. For example, smartwatches can show notifications from a smartphone, track steps taken, or even measure heart rate. This is useful for students who want to stay active or set reminders for study time. Some wearables also support educational apps that can help with learning a new language or practicing math. Wearables make it easier for students to manage their time and health, which can be especially helpful during busy school days.

## Interactive Whiteboards

An *interactive whiteboard* is a large screen used in classrooms to make lessons more dynamic and engaging. The screen is touch-sensitive, which means teachers and students can interact with it by touching or using a stylus. Interactive whiteboards allow teachers to display notes, images, videos, and more. This makes learning more visual and easier to understand. Teachers can also use the board to play educational games, write notes, or draw diagrams. Students can come to the board to solve problems, answer questions, or share ideas with the whole class, making lessons more collaborative.

## Conclusion

These digital devices make both home and school environments more connected and interactive. E-readers allow easy access to many books, smart speakers answer questions and help with reminders, wearables track health and keep students organized, and interactive whiteboards make classroom learning more hands-on. Using these devices can enhance the learning experience and make everyday tasks easier for both students and teachers.
